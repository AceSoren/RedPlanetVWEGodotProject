# RedPlanetVWEGodotProject
Starting almost from scratch, using resources I made for Red Planet for GZDoom
<p>
  There's good reason for a SECOND Red Planet repo on my end. Currently, it is impossible to override hitboxes between actor and map, which can result in weirdness, as in parts of the VTV phasing into the wall or potentially getting destroyed by a 45 degree wall when you didn't expect it. I switched to Godot because one of my objectives is to make the game accessible to lower end hardware.</p>

  The GZDOOM version of my project will still be here if anyone wants to tackle it.
